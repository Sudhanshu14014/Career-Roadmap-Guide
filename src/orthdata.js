        cardDetailedText: `The first step in the path of orthopedic surgery training is to attend college and complete the required pre-requisite course for Medical School. This commonly includes Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Literature, and Physiology courses. Although schools may specify the number and type of courses that are required for application, there is no specific requirement for a certain college major. In fact, some schools do not have a requirement for a completed degree or degrees. This means that students can apply to and get accepted into medical school after around 3 years of college, without having obtained a degree.`,

        cardDetailedText: `In addition to taking the required pre-requisites, pre-med students must also take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). A good score on the MCAT is important in order to be considered for medical school admission. The test is over 6 hours long and separated into four sections: 


        1.Chemical and Physical Foundations of Biological Systems
        2.Critical Analysis and Reasoning Skills (CARS)
        3.Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems
        4.Psychological, Social and Biological Foundations of Behavior
        
        In order to study for the MCAT, some students take MCAT review courses. Completion of an online question bank such as Uworld or Kaplan is also suggested in order to prepare for the exam and receive a good score. Completing required pre-requisite courses before taking the MCAT also helps to prepare students for the exam. Courses like physics, psychology, biology, chemistry, and writing provide an excellent foundation to begin studying for the MCAT.`,

        cardDetailedText: `Once students are admitted to medical school, the next four years are spent completing medical school. Although medical schools may have different class structures, most schools are structured so that students are taking didactic courses during the first two years of school. These courses commonly include:

        Anatomy
        Physiology
        Renal medicine
        Gastrointestinal medicine
        Cardiothoracic medicine
        Urology
        Neurology
        Ethics
        Hepatobiliary medicine
        Obstetrics and gynecology
        Pharmacology
         
        
        After two years of didactics, students usually move to work in hospitals. During this time, termed clinical rotations, students will rotate through different specialties, learning as they go. Medical students usually complete at least 12 months of clinical rotations. Most schools require the completion of
        
        Family Medicine
        Internal Medicine
        Obstetrics and Gynecology
        Psychiatry
        General Surgery
        Emergency Medicine
        Urology
        Neurology
         
        
        Students will also have the ability to schedule elective rotations in other areas. During the fourth year, medical students start applying to residency. They also have the opportunity to rotate at other hospitals with residencies they are interested in. This is called an audition rotation and helps both medical students and residency programs learn more about the program and applicant respectively.`,

For allopathic students in school to receive an MD, these tests are called the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE). For osteopathic medical students in school to receive a DO, these tests are called the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Examination (COMLEX). Both the COMLEX and USMLE have three different parts, termed Step exams for USMLE and Level exams for COMLEX. Step 1 USMLE and Level 1 COMLEX is the first exam that must be passed. This exam typically takes place after 2 years of medical school and is often thought to be the hardest of the exams. The second exam is taken after the third year in school when students have completed their clinical clerkship rotations. This exam covers more clinical information such as pharmacology and clinical management. The last exam, Step 3 or Level 3 is taken after completion of medical school. Most individuals choose to take the exam during their first year of residency. `,

Prior to starting an orthopedic surgery residency, doctors must first complete an intern year. This intern year is spent working in a hospital rotating through different medical and/or surgical specialties. It provides a good educational background for newly graduated physicians. After completing an intern year, doctors can officially begin orthopedic surgery residency which lasts four years. During this time doctors will train in all the facets of medicine including:

        Developing a differential diagnosis
        Performing clinical procedures
        Performing diagnostic maneuvers
        Ordering and interpreting imaging scans
        Writing prescriptions

These exams cover the entirety of orthopedic surgery and are very challenging. The exams are usually several days long and may be virtual or in person. Although board certification is not necessarily required to practice medicine, it is very difficult to find a job at hospitals or any medical company, because employers will not hire doctor practitioners who are not board certified.`,

This requires the orthopedic surgeon to complete a fellowship. Fellowships are similar to residency in that orthopedic surgeons will train in a hospital for at least a year in order to master a facet of orthopedic surgery. Following completion of fellowship, orthopedic surgeons will once again have to take a board examination in their fellowship area to be fully qualified. A list of some of the fellowships available to orthopedic surgeons may be found here.`,
